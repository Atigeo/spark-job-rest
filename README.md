## Features:

**Supports multiple spark contexts created from the same node**

The main problem this project solves is the inability to run multiple Spark contexts from the same JVM. This is a bug in Spark core that was also present in Ooyala's Spark Job Server, from which this project is inspired. The project launches a new process for each Spark context/application, with its own driver memory setting and its own driver log. Each driver JVM is created with its own Spark UI port, sent back to the api caller. Inter-process communication is achieved with akka actors, and each process is shut down when a Spark context/application is deleted.

## Building Spark-job-rest (SJR)

The project is build with maven.
```
mvn clean install
```

## Configure Spark-job-rest

In order to configure SJR the following file needs to be edited: resources/application.conf

* Configure the default spark properties for context creation
``` 
#spark default configuration
spark.executor.memory=2g
spark.mesos.coarse=false
#Default Spark Driver JVM memory
driver.xmxMemory = 1g
```
* Configure settings like web server port and akka system ports
```
#application configuration
appConf{
#the port on which to deploy the apis
web.services.port=8097
........
}
```

Also, SPARK_HOME variable must be edited in the settings.sh file. It must be pointed to the local Spark deployment folder. The SJR can be run from outside the Spark cluster, but you need to at least copy the deployment folder from one of the slaves or master nodes.

## Run Spark-job-rest

After editing all the configuration files SJR can be run by executing the script : start-server.sh

## API

**Contexts**

- POST /context/{contextName}  -  Create Context

 * Body:  Raw entity with key-value pairs. 
 * jars key is required and it should be in the form of a ':' separated list of jar paths. These jars will be added at Spark context creation time to the class path of the newly created context's JVM process.
  ``` 
 jars="/home/ubuntu/example.jar:/home/ubuntu/spark-job-project.jar‚Äù
 spark.executor.memory=2g
 driver.xmxMemory = 1g
  ```

- GET /context/{contextName}  -  returns Context exists. | No such context.

- DELETE /context/{contextName}  -  Delete Context

**Jobs**

- POST /job?runningClass={runningClass}&context={contextName}  - Job Submission 

  * Body:  Raw entity with key-value pairs. Here you can set any configuration properties that will be passed to the config parameter of the validate and run methods of the provided jar (see the SparkJob definition below)

- GET /job?jobId={uuid}&contextName={contextName} - Gets the result or status of a specific job

## Create Spark Job Project

Add maven Spark-Job-Rest dependency:
```
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.xpatterns</groupId>
    <artifactId>spark-job-rest</artifactId>
    <version>0.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

To create a job that can be submitted through the server, the class must implement the SparkJob trait.

```
class Example extends SparkJob {
    override def runJob(sc:SparkContext, jobConfig: Config): Any = { ... }
    override def validate(sc:SparkContext, config: Config): SparkJobValidation = { ... }
}
```

- runJob method contains the implementation of the Job. SparkContext and Config objects are provided through parameters.
- validate method allows for an initial validation. In order to run the job return SparkJobValid(), otherwise return SparkJobInvalid(message).
